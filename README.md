# As per the client requirement we will design and deploy code into the web hosted server which is completely managed by CICD

# We are displying content on the tomcat based web server which is completely managed by using automation with out manual involment

# For storing contents of the project like jenkins files and terraform files, source code we have used GIT as source code management tool

# For continuoes integration we have used JENKINS

# For build, compile, test the source code we have used MAVEN

# For hosting virtual machines we have used AWS CLOUD (2VM's)

# For provisioning the infrastructure we have used terraform 

# when we are discussing the project the content was displying on the webserver "End to End CICD demo for TruNarrative" I have configured the aut  omate build when someone modify the content or do some changes to the code, If you want to have a look you can try once!!

# Below I am sharing the github url where you can find all codes which are used to build this project and web application hosted url as per your   request, Please look into it and let me know if have any questions and concerns.
